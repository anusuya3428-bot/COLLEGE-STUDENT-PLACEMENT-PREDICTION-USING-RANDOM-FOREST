# COLLEGE-STUDENT-PLACEMENT-PREDICTION-USING-RANDOM-FOREST
This project focuses on predicting whether a student will get placed or not placed based on their academic performance, technical skills, and personal attributes using the **Random Forest machine learning algorithm**.

This project aims to predict the placement chances of college students using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The model is trained on a dataset containing student information such as CGPA, internship experience, projects,placement etc.

The model used is a Random Forest Classifier, which is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

The model achieves an accuracy of ~99% on the test dataset.
